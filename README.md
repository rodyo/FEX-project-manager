# FEX-project-manager

Largely based on Vladimir's MATLAB project manager:
https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41585-matlab-project-manager

Changes from his version:
- Tab completion. Place the JSON file in the exact same directory as the projects.m file and you're good to go!
- more intuitive behavior of the load/save commands
- support for sub-projects: just name your project "<mainProject>:<subproject>" and the list format will change accordingly

Normally, all these files are placed in userpath().
